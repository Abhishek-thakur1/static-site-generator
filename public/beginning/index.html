                <p>Hello everybody welcome to my blog. I&#39;ve been considering starting a blog since a few months and I&#39;ve finally decided to go all in and just do it. The main reason holding me back from blogging was actually the fear of running out of topics/having nothing interesting to talk about. But now I&#39;ve decided to just go ahead and start it, if I do run out of topics then I can always stop.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t plan to have a fixed schedule or anything along those lines. I&#39;ll post whenever I have something interesting to share.</p>
<p>Now that you know why I didn&#39;t start a blog till now, let&#39;s get to the title of this post. So why am I starting a blog? Since I have a few reasons let&#39;s bust out the lists:</p>
<h3 id="1-reinforce-my-knowledge">1. Reinforce my knowledge</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve always known that sharing what you know helps reinforce it, but I&#39;ve especially starting feeling it this year in uni. Since me and my friends work together on a lot of things we tend to explain things to each other. But everytime I explain something I tend to not forget it as easily. So this blog will be a great outlet for me to share and also improve my own skills.</p>
<h3 id="2-improve-my-writing">2. Improve my writing</h3>
<p>Ever since my foundation year ended &amp; the first year of uni started, I&#39;ve noticed that I don&#39;t write anything except for code anymore. I&#39;ve also noticed my language skills (both speaking and written) have plummeted (you can probably see that in this post). Hopefully writing a bit every week will save them from further descent.</p>
<h3 id="3-share-my-journey">3. Share my journey</h3>
<p>I know there are a lot more people like me, students who love this field of computers, and I would like to share with them my journey. I&#39;m at a stage where I relate with them, I&#39;ve just been introduced to this amazing world and I feel like a child in a candy shop. I feel like learning about everything and just want to create a lot.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s do it then, hopefully we can grow together and you can gain something from hearing my story. Peace ✌</p>
